# Changefeed Sample
This sample shows how users can log the events in a storage account using Changefeed. The program iterates on a scheduled interval through the changefeed and filters and logs events using a predicate. These filters may be changed in the ChangefeedSample.cs file. The ChangefeedSample program is an Azure Function that can be deployed on Azure, but it can also be run locally with emulation.
The ExampleEventCreator program is an optional program that creates a container and example blobs to create events that populate the Changefeed on a scheduled interval.  By default, both functions run every 30 minutes.
To change the interval of ChangeFeedSample, edit the CRON string in the Run function. To change the interval of ExampleEventCreator, edit the number of milliseconds in the Timer object.

## Prerequisites
Requires installation of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core),
[Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the Azure development workload also installed,
an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), 
an [Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) with [Changefeed enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-change-feed?tabs=azure-portal#enable-and-disable-the-change-feed), 
and an [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-scheduled-function#:~:text=Create%20a%20timer%20triggered%20function%201%20Expand%20your,by%20viewing%20trace%20information%20written%20to%20the%20logs.).

## Code Setup
Before running ExampleEventCreator, users must add values to App.Config for the following variables:
- Connection String

Before running/deploying ChangefeedSample, users must change the variables in the Constants.cs file for the following variables:
- Connection String
- Blob Name (Optional)
- Container Name (Optional)
- Event Type (Optional)

## Step-By-Step Instructions for Running Program
