# Changefeed Sample
This sample shows how users can log the events in a storage account using Changefeed. The program iterates through the changefeed and filters and logs events using a predicate. These filters may be changed in the ChangefeedSample.cs file. The ChangefeedSample program is an Azure Function that can be deployed on Azure, but it can also be run locally with emulation.
The ExampleEventCreator program is an optional program that creates a container and example blobs to create events that populate the Changefeed.
